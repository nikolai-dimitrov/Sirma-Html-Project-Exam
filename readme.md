## In How Our Platform Works section there are 3 icons with circle around them as wrapper with background color: `#e5e5e5` and also in Ready to explore - (section above the footer) in figma background color looks like pure white color (#fff) but background in figma is: #e5e5e5. If i put background color `#e5e5e5` it looks gray and it makes difference between figma design and my implementation.This is the reason for me to leave it #fff.

## Implemented responsive design.
